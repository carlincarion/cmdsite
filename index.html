	<h2>Carlin Carion</h2>
		<p>Hello! I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a bachelor's degree in media and professional communications on the digital media track, in addition to receiving a certificate in sport studies. Since my childhood, I have always had a strong interest in sports. As my interests in digital media grew, I began to pay more attention to the social media content being posted by teams and their media strategies. 

        Over the years, I have noticed the lack of female representation within the sports industry and would love to be a part of narrowing the gap. I would love to use my interest in sports and my skills creating digital content to work in the sports field. 

        While at Pitt, I have acquired valuable skills working with various Adobe applications. I am also gaining hands-on experience creating digital content for the University of Pittsburgh’s American Marketing Association chapter’s social media accounts.
